        <p>Hello, thank you for everything, 
            You honestly gave me so much i want to sya thnk you, your the first person i’ve ever been able to speak about things that i feel actually cares, first person i’ve ever felt safe expressing my feelings, worries and fears. I’m not the same boy you met at the wagon and horse, i’ve grown, emotionally and as person so much because and as thanks to you. <p>
            
            I genuinely think your one of the most kind hearted, most lovely people who always puts people first, even though you don’t believe when i tell you these things its true, i find it ever better that you don’t even realise sometimes and thats whats makes u so special, i could always trust you. I found this hard to write but i hope you don’t mind the bad phrasing and terrible structure, i love you and thank you for the great two years i would never have changed a thing not even slightly and if i had to do it again i would in heart beat xxx 
            <p>
            Your genuinely so beautiful and warm and i’m so glad i’ve seen you grow and become so much more confident and loving in yourself becoming the person i always knew you could be, you can grow even stronger i know you have it in you, and know from the bottom of my heart that i’ll always be on the sidelines cheering you on however corny that sounds. 
            <p>
            Your a genuine bubble of happiness even if you say your always sad I don’t agree, your charismatic, intelligent and so kind that i i’m lucky to have spent so much time beside you as your bf, thank you for everything i really owe you the world for sooo so so so much I don’t think you realise. 
            <p>
            Casper
            <p>
            Ps. There’s probably a 100 things i’ve forgotten or missed to write but i hope thats enoughxx I kept putting this off after writing a little bit as i always felt i had forgot something or I’ll remember to add something else but i feel that may always be the case as you’ve meant, done and been so much for me over the years, i feel i neee to send this to you now or i might never send it
